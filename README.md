# Kid Game (Working Title)

A simple auto-runner game made for small children. 
Multiple levels of complexity are included for different ages.

## Goals
This is mainly an experimental research-project, with several goals:

### 1. Attempt to make a simple child-friendly game
Initially a 1-year-old should be able to rudimentary play the game.
Additionally the idea was to grow the game with the child, as multiple levels of complexity (usually "difficulty") are available for different age-ranges

### 2. Attempt to make a game without any Dependency Injection and RX framework
In my professional environment, I was working mainly with Zenject and UniRx, both of which fundamentally influence the architecture of the game.
Attempting to learn Unreal with C++ proved difficult for me, as DI is simply non-existent, but my thought patterns were already shaped strongly with DI thinking. 
Thus the idea to start a project with a "what-if" approach and eliminating DI and RX completely, in order to learn different approaches and the restrictions of C++ without the additional baggage of another engine and syntax.
