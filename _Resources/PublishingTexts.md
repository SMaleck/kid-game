Gnome and Owl
Help the little gnome to repair his broken house.
This is a simple game, made for very small children. You watch the gnome run through the forest and can click/tap the screen or press SPACE to make him jump.
The levels are freely selectable from the start and grow in complexity.

The scenario and background music is based on a polish lullaby, that was passed on through the generations.
You can find the original song text as well as German and English translations in the game when clicking the book button in the main menu. I could not find many references to it anywhere, which would suggest it to be a very locally known lullaby. So in an unexpected way, this project turned from a fun little experiment into a bit of a preservation effort.

I hope you and your children find some enjoyment with this game.
